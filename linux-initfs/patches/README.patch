Linux-InitFS is designed to work in conjunction with the kernel
makeconfig menu. This patch, linux-initfs.patch, should be applied
from the base of the kernel tree using '-p1'.

It will:
1. Move initramfs/initrd into its own submenu.
2. Add several options about a "default initfs".
3. Allow scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh to call
   executables as well as read text files to
   get its cpio specification.

The individual one-file-per makefiles are in perfile/.
