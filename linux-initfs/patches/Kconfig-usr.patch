+menuconfig INITRAMFS_AUTO
+	bool "Use default built-in initramfs"
+	default n
+	help
+	  Use the stock auto-generated initramfs, and build it into the
+	  kernel binary. It will include the correct early userspace
+	  components to support whatever options you've compiled-in to
+	  this kernel. Note, "Linux::InitFS" from CPAN is required.

+config INITRAMFS_WITH_RESCUE

+	default y
+	help
+	  If set to yes, the initramfs will drop to a shell if it is
+	  unable to find the requested root filesystem. If set to no,
+	  the initramfs will exit and cause kernel panic on failure.
+	  This is really a security decision.

+	  Note that these tools will take up space that needs to be copied
+	  from the disk to RAM as the kernel boots, each time.
+
+config INITRAMFS_WITH_LSENSE
+	boolean "Sense what root filesystem is locally in use"
+	depends on INITRAMFS_AUTO
+	default n
+	help
+	  If set to yes, only those tools required to support the currently
+	  mounted root filesystem will be included in the initramfs, while if
+	  set to no, the tools required to support any compiled-in root file
+	  system option will be included in the initramfs.

+config INITRAMFS_WITH_STATIC
+	boolean "Prefer statically compiled tools in the initramfs"
+	depends on INITRAMFS_AUTO
+	default n
+	help
+	  If set to yes, will look for '.static' versions of any binary
+	  specified to be in the initramfs, in the hope of avoiding having
+	  to include a whole bunch of libraries. If set to no, the default
+	  binary will be used, and any required libraries will be included.
